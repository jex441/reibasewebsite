    <p>Open source is unfair. Have you ever felt burnt out because you have lot of issues to resolve and pull requests to review on your project without much help? Is your employer not supporting you in your open source work? Or perhaps you don’t have a steady paying industry job, but you put a lot of energy and time into open source? Then please listen out for an announcement in the coming days. We are founded on the belief that open source contributors deserve better. We’re adding an open source system on top of git and code hosts that will accomplish this.</p>
    <p>There is widespread discontent. We’ve all read the articles, seen the comments, and heard grumblings from maintainers and other contributors that there is something seriously unfair in the way the gains of open source are distributed. We understand the problem. When you get lot of people and organizations depending on your project, it comes with a lot of unreasonable demands. It can be hard to swallow the unnappreciation of many corporate developers, often pressured by management, that expect immediate bug fixes, new features, or security patches on their timeline. And you’re not even getting paid for it. Of course, it’s not about only money. We must ‘pay it forward’ to others in open source - it’s how we all got to where we are as developers. However, when your project becomes a dependency to very powerful organizations, the relationship can start to feel more like your a vendor in a supply chain than an open source contributor working voluntarily.</p>
    <p>Let’s make contributors happy. We’re Silicon Valley outsiders that span from cybersecurity, finance, and art. We are united by a shared vision. One that dignifies the work of contributors. Self-sustains open source and makes it more secure. That ensures open source remains free to all users. All we did was listen to you, the open source contributor, so it’s really inspired by you. We’re just the painters of this vision. Please, stay tuned for an announcement coming soon here and on Github.</p>
